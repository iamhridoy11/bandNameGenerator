# bandNameGenerator
A Band Name Generator is a simple program that take's user input of their city's and pet's name and finally it shows both the name in a print statement

But essentially, it's a band name generator. And it asks you for a city that you grew up in and the name of your pet.

And then it combines those together and gives you the name of your band.

There's a couple of things to note here.

Firstly is notice when this input got triggered, the cursor actually showed up on a new line.

So if I run this again, you can see it says "What's the name of city you grew up in?"

And then the cursor is on the next line.
